	<h1>Documentary Video of "Paranormal or Conspiracy"</h1>

      <h2>Medium: <span class="title">Adobe Premiere Pro editing with actual costumes and props.</span></h2>
      <h2>Brief Artist Statement: <span class="title">As a child, I have been fascinated with the paranormal and government conspiracies. The main reason why is because the fact that paranormal such as ghosts, bigfoot, UFOs have not been answered to the public if they exist or not. When it comes to government conspiracies, why is this organization is keeping secrets from the public? After doing a thorough research, I have come to conclusion that the answers that we want to seek individually lies within our own personal research. I have also concluded that the media or social media have been developing their own answers or concepts about what the paranormal and conspiracies are about which are very misleading towards the public. After conducting my research and analysis, I have developed a documentary based on my studies about the paranormal and why the media have misled the public about their findings. The concept of this documentary is very similar to a documentary on Netflix or on television.
Most documentaries are at least an hour or over along but the documentary I have developed is approximately 13 minutes long because this time frame is enough to point out he main points of my video to the public. I have used footages found on the internet, mainly on YouTube to describe my main points. I have achieved in developing this documentary using "Adobe Premiere Pro" and "Adobe After Effects." I have developed 3D models with the software program "Blender" to go along with my video which I displayed in SJSU's New Art City virtual gallery. I created models of a ghost, alien, and a bigfoot cast to let the audience know what I will be talking about in my documentary. The ghost and alien are in jpeg form, but the bigfoot cast is an actual 3D model in New Art City. My overall purpose for this project is to spread awareness towards the public to let them know that trusting media or social media is not the answer to finding out about the truth of paranormal.
I don't believe we will ever find the truth about conspiracies or paranormal but at least there are other sources to lead us towards the truth that an individual wants to hear besides listening to what our cellphone tells us...</span></h2>
